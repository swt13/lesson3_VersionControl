            <p class="lead"> Version Control Systems are digital systems that are used to record changes to file sets. The VCS allows for the users to recall previous versions of files. This allows for multiple users to simultaneously work on the same set of files. This is especially useful in buisness and during devolpment of projects. Version Control Systems allow users to access previous versions of a file as well. This can be especially useful when debugging programs and identifying where errors were made. VCS's are crucial in today's information age. </p>

            <p class="lead"> Git is a very unique and highly powerful VCS. Git was designed in 2005 as an alternative to a previous system. The Linux developing community wanted to build a system that would be stronger, faster, and would archive data in a non-linear form. This would allow for more copies of files to be made and managed. Git has evolved since its inception but has the core fundamentals have remained the same. Git utilizes a local repository and a remote repository. Files can not be overwritten and new versions of files are saved as snapshots in the local repositroy. Documents and projects can be readied in the staging area and then pushed to a repository. </p>

            <p class="lead">A local repository is a data stroing system implemented on the users device. The local repository is where files are worked on and handled. The local repositroy allows for multiple snapshots of a file to be stored and viewed. The local repository can only be accessed on a local device and is limited in that sense. </p>

            <p class="lead">A remote repository acts just like a local repositroy except the remote repository acts in the cloud. Files can be modified in the local repository and then with the help of Git, can be pushed to the remote repository. Remote repositories are very functional in the sense that they can be accessed remotely and anywhere. This is useful for working on projects from different locations. The remote repository is what the open source community is built on. </p>

            <p class="lead">Secure Socket Shell is a unix based command interface that secures the entire VCS process. SSH can be identified as a protocol for secruely accessing remote servers and computers. This security is what allwos VCS systems to be used in business. If the file sets could be accessed by anyone on a remote repositroy there would surely be problems. The SSH adds a level of security that allows people to work in provate and maintain control of their own information. Thanks to SSH businesses an work from different locations on the same project in a secure manner. Information is so sensative at time, it is neccessary to be able to control it. </p>
